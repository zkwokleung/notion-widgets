# Notion Widgets

This project contains the source code of my personal notion widgets that fit my daily usages.

The widgets are written with React in Typescript, deployed to github.io with [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages).

## Available Widgets

* [Multi-Language translator](https://zkwokleung.github.io/notion-widgets/#/translator)
* Text-to-Speech word list (2 versions)
    * [Set language for each word](https://zkwokleung.github.io/notion-widgets/#/translator)
    * [Set language for all words](https://zkwokleung.github.io/notion-widgets/#/translator) (change the lang in url)

## Usage

The widgets are available online and can be embedded into anywhere.

For some widgets, if you want to save the changes made to the widget, click on the `Copy Paramalink` button on those pages and re-embed the widget with the copied link.
